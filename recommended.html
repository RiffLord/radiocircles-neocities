	  <i>Heimat <span class="details">(2020)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  meanwhile.in.texas is the moniker of prolific Brindisi
	  musician Angelo Guido, active since 2014. Primarily making
	  ambient music, he has also experimented with drone,
	  industrial, noise, and everything in between. He has
	  released music for labels such as Triple Moon Records, Luce
	  Sia, Sounds Against Humanity, Secret Press, and others.
	  Alongside his main discography stand a number of
	  collaborations with other experimental artists from Italy
	  and abroad,
	  including <a href="https://lucesia.bandcamp.com/album/010-skag-arcade-meanwhile-in-texas-fernweh">Skag
	    Arcade</a>, <a href="https://shopendtitles.bandcamp.com/album/endurance">Mulo
	    Muto</a>,
	  and <a href="https://sonorus-records.bandcamp.com/album/golden-ruins-son008">Rooms
	    Delayed</a>. Last but not least, he was one half of the
	  duo <a href="https://soundsagainsthumanity.bandcamp.com/album/ambient-sketches-for-fearless-hearts">Superdad</a>.
	  <br>
	  Always searching for novel ways to produce atmospheric
	  sounds, his primary tool is the electric guitar, which he
	  uses with a great number of effects pedals (many of them
	  built by himself) and unconventional playing and production
	  techniques to create lush and evocative soundscapes. His
	  sound is further enriched by several curious experimental
	  sound-generators and percussion instruments (these also
	  self-built), synthesizers, and field recordings.
	  <br>
	  One of my closest friends, it is Angelo who first taught me
	  the basics of field recording, and over the years we've been
	  on many a recording session together around the outskirts of
	  his home town of Brindisi.
	  <br>
	  We have also collaborated on a short-lived live project
	  called Bright Noise Motel, with Angelo handling electronics
	  and soundscapes and myself on bass guitar.
	  <br>
	  His entire discography is a gem and I highly encourage you
	  to give all of his releases a listen. If I had to choose a
	  single album of his to recommend, that would be Heimat,
	  released in 2020 (but I can't resist an honourable
	  mention, <a href="https://soundsagainsthumanity.bandcamp.com/album/endless-decay">Endless
	    Decay</a>).
	  <br>
	  Organic and warm, the mix of abstract guitar loops, field
	  recordings and synthesizers depict hazy scenes that blur the
	  distinctions between memories and imagination. Heimat means
	  homeland in German. The album is thus an introspective
	  reflection on one's origins, exploring the relationship
	  between person and birthplace, childhood and present.
	  <br>

	  out <a href="https://secretpress.bandcamp.com/track/santandrea">Sant'Andrea</a>
	  and <a href="https://secretpress.bandcamp.com/track/conca">Conca</a>.
	  <br>
	  To sum up the music of meanwhile.in.texas in a single
	  phrase, these are soundtracks for films that don't exist.

	</div>
	<p>
	  Hetrem are from my home town of Å iroki Brijeg. In an area of
	  the world where there is very little new music being made
	  &mdash; alternative or otherwise &mdash; they are a bastion of
	  resistance, offering something far different and far more
	  intense than what
	  is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx5qi1VI05I">usually
	    heard</a> around our neck of the woods. They play death metal
	  with strong progressive and melodic influences. The
	  intertwined guitar riffs are sweet and intricate. The drums
	  are impeccably precise. The vocals are <em>brutal</em>.
	  <br>
	  <em>Monster at Heart</em> is their second album, released a
	  decade after the debut, and their musical and conceptual
	  growth is perfectly realised at this point. The typical
	  death metal intensity is nicely contrasted with atmospheric
	  synthesizer sections and even some acoustic guitar
	  on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67RmBgDLeAc">The
	    Heredity of Taste</a>, which makes the heavier tracks all
	  the more impactful. Their Balkan origins shine through in
	  the main riff
	  on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdIs1HHONs4">Gemini</a>.
	  My favourite track on this record is most
	  probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JULI7zh1vz8">The
	    Thorn</a>.
	  <br>
	  Guitarist Pipo built his own guitar which was used to record
	  on this album. Zvone, the band's vocalist is also a
	  published author, and the first volume of a fantasy saga he
	  is writing was
	  recently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9VPQ8MF">translated
	    to English</a>, so if that's your cup of tea be sure to
	  check it out.

	<p>
	  Last Resistance are an alternative metal band from Brindisi
	  formed a few years before this release by my university buddy
	  Lorenzo. <em>A World Painted Grey</em> is their debut EP
	  and was preceded and followed by a steady flow of live
	  activity around the Salento and Bari areas.
	  Lorenzo is a great guitarist, and although short, this EP is a
	  flurry of riffs both heavy and melodic.
	  <br>
	  The band have been slowly but surely working on their first
	  full-length record ever since this EP was released and I'm
	  told it's coming some time soon. In the mean time, feast
	  yourselves on this very satisfying taster of what Last
	  Resistance have to offer.

	  <i>In the Name Of <span class="details">(2024)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Maverick Persona is the brainchild of Amerigo Verardi and
	  Matteo D'Astore. The former, singer-songwriter and producer,
	  is a darling of the Italian alternative music underground
	  since the 1980s, and arguably the only musician from Brindisi
	  to make a name and career for himself on the national scene.
	  The latter is one of Brindisi's finest young electronic
	  musicians and producers.
	  <br>
	  This unlikely pairing of two generations and musical
	  backgrounds that are very far apart has birthed one of the
	  most eclectic albums to ever emerge from the Apulian
	  hinterlands. <em>In the Name Of</em>, like
	  their <a href="https://maverickpersona.bandcamp.com/album/what-tomorrow">debut
	    album</a> before it, is a melting pot of jazzy, psychedelic
	  electronica, pop, and many other styles, bursting with
	  colourful chords, inventive synthesizer sounds, and rhythms
	  both groovy and unconventional. The vocals often sound as
	  though they were transmitted from an offshore pirate radio
	  station from the 1970s.
	  <br>
	  While the entire album is excellent, the opening tracks
	  <a href="https://maverickpersona.bandcamp.com/track/complete-the-task">Complete
	    the Task</a>
	  and <a href="https://maverickpersona.bandcamp.com/track/somewhere-we-have-landed">Somewhere
	    We

	  and <a href="https://maverickpersona.bandcamp.com/track/dreaming-laurel-canyon">Dreaming
	    Laurel Canyon</a>, the latter of which

	  <i>RÄká¹£asa - Side A <span class="details">(2022)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Deje is Matteo D'Astore's moniker. As mentioned in the above
	  section on <a href="#maverick-persona">Maverick Persona</a>,
	  he is one of Brindisi's most promising musicians. A
	  multi-instrumentalist, he started out on drums and percussion
	  before moving on to keyboards and bass as well as producing.
	  <br>
	  We have a bit of shared musical history, since he was the
	  drummer of the second band I ever played in (Starfleet, led by
	  Simon Chiatante on guitar, I was on bass) and we had our first
	  experiences in a recording studio working on an EP for said
	  band.
	  <br>
	  <em>RÄká¹£asa</em> is the first volume of a collaboration with
	  Simon Chiatante, with whom I also worked on
	  the <a href="albums.html#stories-in-the-dust">first Odd Radio
	    Circles album</a> at around the same time.
	  <br>
	  This is dark and brooding electronic music influenced by
	  Oriental poetry and philosophy. The reverbs, synthesizer
	  patches, and electric piano used throughout the work evoke a
	  strong night-time atmosphere, so much so that I suggest
	  listening to it as late as possible in a desolate area on the
	  outskirts of town, ideally with a couple of beers.
	  <br>
	  The highlights of this work
	  are <a href="https://deje.bandcamp.com/track/mimi-nashi-h-ichi">Mimi-nashi
	    HÅichi</a>, <a href="https://deje.bandcamp.com/track/rokurokubi">Rokurokubi</a>

	  Check out the wonky drums on the latter, I can't get enough of
	  that one beat that keeps coming a split-second too late!

	<p>
	  Edoardo Cammisa, also known as Banished Pills is a sound
	  artist from Turin, Italy, active since 2013. He also heads the
	  record
	  label <a href="https://soundsagainsthumanity.bandcamp.com/">Sounds
	    Against Humanity</a> with which I released two albums for my
	  former project, Transmissions.
	  <br>
	  While starting off producing ambient and drone music, over the
	  years he grew increasingly interested in the relationship
	  between sound and silence, culminating in his most recent
	  avant-garde works that might even be described
	  as <em>non-music</em>.
	  <br>
	  <em>Flux</em> is as much a meditation as it is an album, and
	  in place of traditional musical instruments, Edoardo used
	  the signals and feedback produced by contact microphones
	  recorded to tape and broken walkmans in order to focus the
	  listener towards the very essence of recorded sound.

	<p>
	  Paco Maddalena is a filmmaker from Brindisi. It shouldn't come
	  as a surprise then that his music is very cinematic. Like his
	  compatriot <a href="#meanwhile-in-texas">meanwhile.in.texas</a>,
	  Paco also makes ambient music, albeit with an even heavier
	  focus on field recordings, and with synthesizers much more in
	  the forefront.
	  <br>
	  Starting off extremely minimal with the field recordings in
	  full focus and barely perceptible synthesizer drones
	  underneath, <em>Panorami verticali</em> initially transmits a
	  sense of gravity and density, which then blossoms into an
	  airy, weightless, and hazy scene on the
	  track <a href="https://pacomaddalena.bandcamp.com/track/troppe-trame">Troppe
	    trame</a>, before it morphs into something dark and menacing.

	<p>
	  Mindwarp were a band from Brindisi which showed immense
	  promise, but alas broke up too soon to really live up to their
	  full potential (they lasted no more than 3 years). Thankfully
	  they left us this EP which gives the listener a glimpse of
	  what they had to offer. Although the production on this, their
	  only published work is regrettably a little bit flat, their
	  creativity can be heard regardless &mdash; a delightful mix of
	  stoner metal, progressive, and psychedelic rock, nothing less
	  than what their name promises. They were bigger than the sum
	  of their parts, an instrumental trio of guitar, bass, and
	  drums which sounded massive both live and in the rehearsal
	  space. Mindwarp had a couple of other tracks written by the time
	  this EP was released which were even more far-out than these
	  &mdash; shame they never managed to record them.
	  <br>
	  The drumming and bass playing on this record are excellent,
	  as is the guitar work. What I appreciated about this band was
	  that nobody tried to steal the spotlight from the others. They
	  were perfectly synchronised between each other, and worked
	  together in service of the music they played.
	  <br>
	  The highlight of this EP is most certainly the closing
	  track <a href="https://acidcosmonautrecords.bandcamp.com/track/iramocram">Iramocram</a>.
	  Here's a video of them

	  <i>A Mournful Ground <span class="details">(2022)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Funeral Boogie are a very raw doom metal band from Lecce,
	  Italy. Unlike many doom metal bands, they aren't slow except
	  when slowness is needed. The drumming is primitive, the guitar
	  riffs are dirty, the bass is big, and the vocals are harsh.
	  This is their debut full-length album, but they also have a
	  <a href="https://funeralboogie.bandcamp.com/album/funeral-boogie-demo-2017">demo
	    EP</a> out which is worth a listen.
	  <br>
	  I played bass with them for a year, an experience that
	  culminated in the band's first live performance at the sorely
	  missed <em>Istanbul CafÃ©</em> in the tiny town of Squinzano,
	  which used to be a Mecca for metalheads across the Salento
	  area before it was forced to close.
	  <br>
	  This album will pummel you into oblivion with its relentless
	  riffing, hoarse shouting, and Neanderthal drumming. Be sure to
	  listen to the
	  exceptional <a href="https://funeralboogie.bandcamp.com/track/riding-rats-2">Riding
	    Rats</a>, which	channels the spirit of the late, great Lemmy
	  and his	MotÃ¶rhead. This one was so much fun to play! We
	  wrote <a href="https://funeralboogie.bandcamp.com/track/black-hole-truth">Black
	    Hole Truth</a> together based on guitarist/vocalist Stefano's
	  intro guitar riff, and although I left the band before work on

	  hear it on record. My favourite track on this album is without
	  a

	<p>
	  If you've ever wondered what hip hop from Herzegovina sounds
	  like, just listen to <em>Gan Barsi</em>. Noti Limun is from
	  Å iroki Brijeg and I've known him since he was a teenager. Even

	  on the spot, and I was always inspired by the limitless energy
	  he constantly displayed. This album doesn't follow popular
	  trends. There are a couple of quasi-trap beats here
	  and there but you will find no trace of auto-tune, and
	  the sound is firmly rooted in the darker hip hop of the late
	  2000s and early 2010s. Noti Limun's beats and lyrics burst
	  with testosterone and the rhymes are both inventive and witty,
	  though of course you'd need to understand Croatian (or
	  Bosnian, Serbian, or Montenegrin). Nevertheless, even if you
	  can't speak a word of the Yugoslav family of languages, you
	  can still appreciate the flow, for flow is universal.

	</div>
	<p>
	  IzÅ are a wonderful post-metal band from Lecce, Italy. They
	  came onto the local scene already artistically mature and
	  with a clear vision, which is perfectly captured on their
	  debut album. Their music is an evocative mix of crushing
	  heaviness and vast, psychedelic atmospherics. I've seen
	  them live on three occasions and always returned home with
	  my ears ringing and my soul soaring. For the most part
	  instrumental, as on this record, their lineup consisted of
	  twin guitars, bass, and drums, although they did add vocals
	  and synthesizers to their sound by 2017. Unfortunately they
	  appear to be on hiatus as of 2018, but if this turns out to
	  be their only recorded work, they left us with a good one.

	  <i>La capitale del male <span class="details">(2016)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Hate & Merda ("merda" means "shit" in Italian) are a
	  misanthropic duo from Florence, Italy who seamlessly merge
	  doom metal with hardcore punk. <em>La capitale del male</em>
	  (in English, "The Capital of Evil") is their second album,
	  even meaner and more cathartic than
	  their <a href="https://diodrone.bandcamp.com/album/lanno-dellodio">magnificent
	  debut</a>.
	  <br>
	  The music of Hate & Merda is an exorcism of all the darkness
	  we keep hidden in our souls, which is released through the
	  down-tuned guitars, pounding but elaborate drums, and
	  poetic, introspective lyrics that are desperately screamed
	  by guitarist NÃ resh Ran. I believe this to be their best
	  album, but everything they've put out to date is wonderful
	  and I emphatically invite you to listen to the whole
	  discography.
	  <br>
	  NÃ resh also
	  produces <a href="https://nareshran.bandcamp.com/album/gli-alberi-non-vogliono">experimental
	  ambient music</a> which is worth checking out.

	     href="https://zolfo.bandcamp.com/album/delusion-of-negation">
	    <img class="cover-art"

	  <i>Delusion of Negation <span class="details">(2020)</span></i>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Zolfo (meaning "sulfur" in Italian) are a sludge metal band
	  from Bari, Italy. Grimy, slow and so heavy as to end
	  up being psychedelic, their music is as much an assault on
	  the senses as the homonymous substance is. The album opens
	  with a
	  tense <a href="https://zolfo.bandcamp.com/track/neural-worm">soundscape</a>
	  by my good
	  friend <a href="#meanwhile-in-texas">meanwhile.in.texas</a>,
	  and then proceeds to bludgeon the listener with riff after
	  riff over the rest of the album's runtime.
	  <br>
	  In a genre which often sounds repetitive and monotonous,
	  Zolfo's music sounds surprisingly fresh (perhaps rotten
	  might be a more appropriate term), with their expansive
	  compositions developing to satisfying conclusions as the
	  vocalist obliterates the listener's ears and his own throat
	  with every form of scream, shout, and guttural growl the
	  human body is capable of producing.
