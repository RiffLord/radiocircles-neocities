      <p class="biography">
	Odd Radio Circles is an electronic music project by Bruno Pezer.
	Hailing from the small town of Široki Brijeg in Bosnia & Herzegovina,
	Bruno spent his childhood between his homeland and various countries
	abroad, settling in the sleepy coastal city of Brindisi in the South
	of Italy where he spent his formative years.
	<br><br>
	He first approached music through the guitar and bass, playing
	alone and in various short-lived local groups. Always
	nurturing a fascination for the atmospheric, otherworldly, and
	sometimes surreal sounds that only synthesizers could make,
	his interest in electronic, ambient, and experimental music
	grew over the years, eventually resulting in his first
	attempts at writing and producing under the moniker
	Transmissions.
	<br><br>
	His music is a blend of ambient-electronica atmospheres, steady
	beats, minimalism, drone, psychedelia, and spacey synth-pop
	melodies.
	<br><br>
	His first releases were for the independent record
	labels <a href="https://triplemoonrecords.bandcamp.com/">Triple
	Moon Records</a>, on which he made an appearance in a
	compilation,
	and <a href="https://soundsagainsthumanity.bandcamp.com/">Sounds
	Against Humanity</a> with which he produced two albums. A
	further EP and full length were	self-released, with some
	sporadic live activity and collaborations with other musicians
	taking place.
	<br><br>
	The 2020 pandemic and resulting national quarantine in Italy
	brought with it a need for change, and though stylistically
	following the same direction, Transmissions was reborn as Odd
	Radio Circles. The first track for the new project was
	commissioned for a program on an independent radio station in
	Louisiana, USA. Odd Radio Circles' first album, Stories in the
	Dust was reworked from unreleased Transmissions material in
	collaboration with the poet Simon Chiatante and released in
	2021. The next couple of years brought an EP and a few
	experimental singles resulting from further collaborations,
	including appearances
	on <a href="https://chelidonframe.site/home">Chelidon
	  Frame</a>'s <a href="https://www.asynchronousdroneorchestra.eu/">Asynchronous
	Drone Orchestra</a>. In the meantime, work was slowly but
	surely taking place on the follow-up full-length, Concerto for
	Fish, originally conceived as a	Transmissions album in 2018.
	<br><br>
	Odd Radio Circles currently resides in Berlin, Germany, and is
	always developing ideas for further releases.
