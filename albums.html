      <!-- 	<p> -->
      <!-- 	  The second full-length album by Odd Radio Circles, like most -->
      <!-- 	  of the material released up to this point, began while I was -->
      <!-- 	  still operating as Transmissions, having written the first -->
      <!-- 	  couple of tracks that would end up on it during the summer -->
      <!-- 	  of 2018. A number of demos and half-formed new tracks were -->
      <!-- 	  written by the first months of 2019. By that point, writer's -->
      <!-- 	  block overwhelmed me as I was attempting to work on -->
      <!-- 	  several different projects simultaneously; <em>Stories in -->
      <!-- 	  the Dust</em>; what would later turn out to be -->
      <!-- 	  Transmissions' last -->
      <!-- 	  album, <a href="https://transmissionsfrombeyond.bandcamp.com/album/borderlands">Borderlands</a>; -->
      <!-- 	  playing bass with the Lecce-based doom metal -->
      <!-- 	  band <a href="https://funeralboogie.bandcamp.com/">Funeral -->
      <!-- 	  Boogie</a>. Work on this album slowed down as other -->
      <!-- 	  matters&mdash;musical and non&mdash;took priority, and -->
      <!-- 	  became ever more sporadic over the years as I struggled to -->
      <!-- 	  overcome my perceived limitations in writing and arranging. -->
      <!-- 	  While this music is somewhat experimental, I did want to -->
      <!-- 	  maintain a level of accessibility, melody, and relatively -->
      <!-- 	  traditional structure which proved to be the greatest -->
      <!-- 	  struggle. Often during this period months would pass before -->
      <!-- 	  I opened the project files and any progress I did make felt -->
      <!-- 	  negligible. Finally, in the summer of 2023 when I decided I -->
      <!-- 	  would be moving to Berlin before the year was over, I -->
      <!-- 	  understood that if I was to finish this work it had to be -->
      <!-- 	  soon; the bulkiest of my gear would remain down in Brindisi -->
      <!-- 	  and time was running out. After several years of doubts and -->
      <!-- 	  setbacks, forcing myself to finish writing and recording the -->
      <!-- 	  incomplete tracks proved to be the solution to my writer's -->
      <!-- 	  block, and I am very pleased with the results. -->
      <!-- 	  <br> -->
      <!-- 	  Although the bulk of this album was written and recorded in -->
      <!-- 	  2018&ndash;2019 and 2021&ndash;2023, it contains some of my -->
      <!-- 	  earliest ideas: I wrote the main riff on <em>Fairyland</em> -->
      <!-- 	  on the acoustic guitar while still in high-school, influenced -->
      <!-- 	  by Gentle Giant. I rediscovered the recordings while -->
      <!-- 	  starting work on the album, was quite impressed with how -->
      <!-- 	  the part sounded when played on a synthesizer and the rest -->
      <!-- 	  of the track was built around it. This was one of the -->
      <!-- 	  first pieces on the album which I finished writing. -->
      <!-- 	  <br> -->
      <!-- 	  <em>Margaret</em> was likewise one of the first pieces of -->
      <!-- 	  music I came up with, no later than 2010. This track was -->
      <!-- 	  originally featured on -->
      <!-- 	  my <a href="https://soundsagainsthumanity.bandcamp.com/album/transmissions">first -->
      <!-- 	  album</a> released in 2017 for Sounds Against Humanity, and -->
      <!-- 	  since the idea fit perfectly with the theme of <em>Concerto -->
      <!-- 	  for Fish</em>, I reworked it and re-recorded it from -->
      <!-- 	  scratch. The final section was heavily inspired by the ending -->
      <!-- 	  of Gino -->
      <!-- 	  Vannelli's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RllF8te6VD4">The -->
      <!-- 	  Evil Eye</a>. It was the final track recorded for this -->
      <!-- 	  album. The piece features alleged samples of a dolphin named -->
      <!-- 	  Peter, from a program to attempt to teach dolphins human -->
      <!-- 	  language conducted -->
      <!-- 	  by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Lilly">John -->
      <!-- 	    C. Lilly</a> -->
      <!-- 	  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Howe_Lovatt">Margaret -->
      <!-- 	  Howe Lovatt</a> in the 1960s. The remaining samples are of -->
      <!-- 	  Margaret herself teaching Peter simple phrases and -->
      <!-- 	  documenting the process. -->
      <!-- 	  <br> -->
      <!-- 	  <em>Intertidal Zones</em> was originally written in 2013 and -->
      <!-- 	  first released under the -->
      <!-- 	  title <a href="https://transmissionsfrombeyond.bandcamp.com/track/daydream">Daydream</a> -->
      <!-- 	  on my second release as Transmissions. -->
      <!-- 	  The second section of <em>Digital Dawn</em> was inspired by -->
      <!-- 	  a short electronic bleep that could be heard when selecting -->
      <!-- 	  certain options in the main menu of the Xbox One console, -->
      <!-- 	  with the rest of the track being built around that; -->
      <!-- 	  <em>Ultramarine</em> was inspired by Steve Reich & vaporwave -->
      <!-- 	  music; <em>Q</em> takes inspiration from science-fiction -->
      <!-- 	  soundtracks from the 1960s and 1970s. -->
      <!-- 	  <br> -->
      <!-- 	  <em>Concerto for Fish</em> is in large part a tribute to the -->
      <!-- 	  places I grew up in, especially my homeland of Herzegovina -->
      <!-- 	  and Brindisi, with both places featured in the -->
      <!-- 	  photographs on the album's artwork. The front cover picture was -->
      <!-- 	  taken on a fishing expedition -->
      <!-- 	  at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blidinje_Lake">Blidinje -->
      <!-- 	    lake</a> in 2009. The back is a blurred photograph -->
      <!-- 	  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C5%A1tica_(river)">LiÅ¡tica -->
      <!-- 	  river</a>. The photographs on the inside and disc were taken -->
      <!-- 	  at <a href="https://www.brundarte.it/la-diga-punta-riso-brindisi/">Diga -->
      <!-- 	  di Punta Riso</a>, Brindisi. -->
      <!-- 	  The field recordings that can be heard throughout the work -->
      <!-- 	  were mostly recorded in and around the quiet neighbourhood I -->
      <!-- 	  lived in in Brindisi. -->

	<p>
	  This (very) short EP is comprised of only two proper tracks,
	  linked by a third, atonal 30-second
	  fragment. <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/arthropods">Arthropods</a>
	  was originally written in 2018 with the poet Simon Chiatante
	  for what would later become our collaborative album and
	  first Odd Radio Circles full-length, <em>Stories in the
	    Dust</em>. The arrangement was revisited and completed in 2020
	  as we were working on the aforementioned album, and was meant
	  to be included on it. As the latter took shape we realised
	  this track had quite a different feel from the other pieces
	  and clashed with the overall atmosphere of the work, so it was
	  removed from the final product. The track was influenced as
	  much by 1990s electronica as it was by classic 1970s
	  progressive rock.
	  <br>
	  <em>Plankton</em> was the result of my attempt to learn how to
	  operate a sequencer and MIDI keyboard I had just acquired at
	  the time. The sounds produced reminded me of tiny organisms
	  swimming through the superficial waters of the ocean, and I
	  liked it enough to want to release it in some form.
	  <br>
	  <em>Mycelial Network</em> came from a guitar riff I would
	  often play as an exercise. After realising it sounded
	  interesting when played on a synthesizer, I started working
	  on an arrangement around that riff, with drums influenced by
	  the electronic sounds on Adrian
	  Belew's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nO5HBvNzkE2LtVwMu5bvZGW22Hu4mRPXI">Side

	<p>
	  The first full-length album by Odd Radio Circles is a
	  collaborative work written and recorded with the poet Simon
	  Chiatante, mostly over the course of the first year of the
	  COVID-19 pandemic. While I have collaborated with Simon on a
	  number of projects in the past, this is the first one we
	  have managed to complete and publish. In fact the album and
	  its cover art were originally conceived well before Odd
	  Radio Circles, while I was still operating under the moniker
	  Transmissions. We had recorded a series of ideas, snippets,
	  and demos over the course of the winter of 2018, which were
	  subsequently partially abandoned as parallel work on other
	  projects began and writer's block started to set in. Some of
	  this material was performed live on a couple of occasions,
	  but mostly left undeveloped.
	  <br>
	  As Italy found itself in a series of lockdowns of varying
	  degrees of severity in the first half of 2020 we found
	  ourselves with little to do, nowhere to go, and a lot of
	  free time on our hands, which compelled us to start work on
	  a new project. After reviewing the material we had up to
	  that point, a lot of it was discarded as I felt it was
	  somewhat directionless, lacked satisfying structure or
	  intention. Furthermore, by that point I had already decided
	  to end the Transmissions project and settled for a new name.
	  What material did survive from the original recordings ended
	  up on the
	  tracks <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/magnetic-fields">Magnetic
	    Fields</a>, <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/sitting">Sitting</a>,
	  and <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/coda">Coda</a>.
	  <br>
	  A lot of the material is based on semi-improvised parts
	  performed on guitar or synthesizer by Simon or myself that
	  were subsequently fleshed out and patched together. Simon's
	  idea to write a few stanzas of minimalist poetry to
	  accompany each of the tracks informed the album's concept,
	  which represents a spiritual journey linking the earthly
	  plane (side A, tracks 1-4) to the celestial plane (side B,
	  tracks 5-7).
	  <br>
	  Field recordings feature heavily across the album, most of
	  them taken in Brindisi, Italy; a few of the field recordings
	  on <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/stillness">Stillness</a>
	  were taken in Berlin, Germany and Shenzhen, China.
	  On <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/moon">Moon</a>,
	  I recorded Simon lifting, dropping, and shuffling some
	  stones at the foot of the ruined lighthouse
	  at <a href="https://www.brundarte.it/la-diga-punta-riso-brindisi/">Diga
	  di Punta Riso</a> on the Brindisi coastline. These
	  recordings were looped, heavily reverberated and their
	  pitches manipulated, achieving the spacey and haunting
	  soundscape which inspired the track's title. The improvised
	  guitar was inspired by The Walker
	  Brothers' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24qn991dxiQ">The
	  Electrician</a>.
	  <br>
	  <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/gate">Gate</a>
	  is an attempt to translate into music the same sort of
	  abstraction that was expressed visually by artists such
	  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint">Hilma
	  af Klint</a>. The track was borne of an attempt to play something akin to a
	  slowed down Japanese <em>gagaku</em> on a synthesizer.
	  <br>
	  The album's
	  opener, <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/earth">Earth</a>
	  was inspired in equal parts by the magnificent band of the
	  same name and the minimalist music of Terry Riley and La
	  Monte Young, the latter of which have indeed influenced the
	  entirety of this album.
