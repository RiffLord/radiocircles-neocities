	<p>
	  The first full-length album by Odd Radio Circles is a
	  collaborative one written and recorded with the poet Simon
	  Chiatante, mostly over the course of the first year of the
	  COVID-19 pandemic. While I have collaborated with Simon on a
	  number of projects in the past, this is the first one we
	  have managed to complete and publish. In fact the album and
	  its cover art were originally conceived well before Odd
	  Radio Circles, while I was still operating under the moniker
	  Transmissions. We had recorded a series of ideas, snippets,
	  and demos over the course of the winter of 2018, which were
	  subsequently partially abandoned as parallel work on other
	  projects began and writer's block started to set in. Some of
	  this material was performed live on a couple of occasions,
	  but mostly left undeveloped.
	  <br>
	  As Italy found itself in a series of lockdowns of varying
	  degrees of severity in the first half of 2020 we found
	  ourselves with little to do, nowhere to go, and a lot of
	  free time on our hands, which compelled us to start work on
	  a new project. After reviewing the material we had up to
	  that point, a lot of it was discarded as I felt it was
	  somewhat directionless, lacked satisfying structure or
	  intention. Furthermore, by that point I had already decided
	  to end the Transmissions project and settled for a new name.
	  What material did survive from the original recordings ended
	  up on the
	  tracks <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/magnetic-fields">Magnetic
	    Fields</a>, <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/sitting">Sitting</a>,
	  and <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/coda">Coda</a>.
	  <br>
	  A lot of the material is based on semi-improvised parts
	  performed on guitar or synthesizer by Simon or myself that
	  were subsequently fleshed out and patched together. Simon's
	  idea to write a few stanzas of minimalist poetry to
	  accompany each of the tracks informed the album's concept,
	  which represents a spiritual journey linking the earthly
	  plane (side A, tracks 1-4) to the celestial plane (side B,
	  tracks 5-7).
	  <br>
	  Field recordings feature heavily across the album, most of
	  them taken in Brindisi, Italy; a few of the field recordings
	  on <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/stillness">Stillness</a>
	  were taken in Berlin, Germany and Shenzhen, China.
	  On <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/moon">Moon</a>,
	  I recorded Simon lifting, dropping, and shuffling some
	  stones at the foot of the ruined lighthouse
	  at <a href="https://www.brundarte.it/la-diga-punta-riso-brindisi/">Diga
	  di Punta Riso</a> on the Brindisi coastline. These
	  recordings were looped, heavily reverberated and their
	  pitches manipulated, achieving the spacey and haunting
	  soundscape which inspired the track's title. The improvised
	  guitar was inspired by The Walker
	  Brothers' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24qn991dxiQ">The
	  Electrician</a>.
	  <br>
	  <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/gate">Gate</a>
	  is an attempt to translate into music the same sort of
	  abstraction that was expressed visually by artists such
	  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint">Hilma
	  af Klint</a>. The track was borne of an attempt to play something akin to a
	  slowed down Japanese <em>gagaku</em> on a synthesizer.
	  <br>
	  The album's
	  opener, <a href="https://radiocircles.bandcamp.com/track/earth">Earth</a>
	  was inspired in equal parts by the magnificent band of the
	  same name and the minimalist music of Terry Riley and La
	  Monte Young, the latter of which have indeed influenced the
	  entirety of this album.
